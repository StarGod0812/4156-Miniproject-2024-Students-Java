# Bugs Fixed in 4156 Individual Project

## Bugs Fixed in RouteController.java

1. **Unnecessary Use of 'value' in Annotations**
   - **Location**: RouteController.java
   - **Description**: The 'value' attribute in annotations was unnecessary when it was the only attribute.
   - **Fix**: Removed the 'value' attribute where it was not needed.

2. **Loose Coupling with Implementation Types**
   - **Location**: RouteController.java
   - **Description**: The code used concrete 'HashMap' instances instead of the 'Map' interface, leading to tight coupling.
   - **Fix**: Replaced 'HashMap' with 'Map' to follow the interface segregation principle.

3. **Unused Local Variables**
   - **Location**: RouteController.java
   - **Description**: Local variables were declared but not used in the code.
   - **Fix**: Removed the unused local variables to clean up the code.

## Bugs Fixed in IndividualProjectApplication.java

1. **Improper String Comparisons**
   - **Location**: IndividualProjectApplication.java
   - **Description**: String comparisons were not placing literals first, which is a best practice to prevent potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
   - **Fix**: Modified string comparisons to place literals first.

2. **Loose Coupling with Implementation Types**
   - **Location**: IndividualProjectApplication.java
   - **Description**: The code used concrete 'HashMap' instances instead of the 'Map' interface.
   - **Fix**: Replaced 'HashMap' with 'Map' to reduce coupling.

## Bugs Fixed in MyFileDatabase.java

1. **Methods Returning Null Instead of Empty Map**
   - **Location**: MyFileDatabase.java
   - **Description**: Methods were returning null instead of an empty Map, which could lead to `NullPointerExceptions`.
   - **Fix**: Modified methods to return an empty Map instead of null.

2. **File Path Check in Constructor**
   - **Location**: MyFileDatabase.java
   - **Description**: The constructor did not validate the file path, which could lead to issues when attempting to read or write to the file.
   - **Fix**: Added checks in the constructor to ensure the file path is valid.

## Bugs Fixed in Department.java

1. **Unused Import Statements**
   - **Location**: Department.java
   - **Description**: There were unused import statements in the file, which can clutter the code.
   - **Fix**: Removed all unused import statements.

2. **Fixed Return Results**
   - **Location**: Department.java
   - **Description**: Methods were not returning the correct results due to incorrect logic or missing validation.
   - **Fix**: Corrected the logic in methods to ensure they return accurate results.

3. **Check Before Dropping Person from Major**
   - **Location**: Department.java
   - **Description**: The method to drop a person from a major did not check if there were any majors to drop.
   - **Fix**: Added a check to ensure that the number of majors is greater than zero before attempting to drop a person.

## Additional Formatting and Code Style Issues

- **Line Length and Indentation**
   - **Location**: Various files
   - **Description**: Lines exceeded the recommended length, and indentation was not consistent.
   - **Fix**: Adjusted line lengths and ensured consistent indentation.

- **Proper Placement of Braces and Semicolons**
   - **Location**: Various files
   - **Description**: Braces and semicolons were not placed according to style guidelines.
   - **Fix**: Reformatted code to follow consistent brace and semicolon placement rules.
